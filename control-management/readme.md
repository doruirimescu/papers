# Purpose / Abstract
Drawing a parallel between a control system (well-established, studied, heuristics available, strong intuitions developed) and a software management system (new, emerging field, complex challenges, benefits from heuristics).

# Introduction
Present challenges of software development organizations today. Scrum and Agile. Present basic principles of control systems. Introduce key concepts.

# Methodology
1. Establish a correspondence between the block diagram of a common control system and a software organization
2. Identify and briefly describe each block component, and its corresponding signal
3. Identify each possible disturbance
4. 

We can turn it into management control system.
The issue is: 
- discrete control system. Not continuous input. Disturbance may not be traceable within each block
- instead of doing multi input single output, we can have all in one box. Everything is like management control system.

Master control system should be like management control system, to control the profit target. Controlling burndown and money. Inside, we have "functional control system". Instead of having one pipeline for the input. 

Cascade control system
Try to create a storyline: The investment starts with 100 million. The customer is requesting a product with this feature. Then, there are 10 developers doing. The product owner's function
is like switching/multiplexing. Eventually we will know what to do first.

Storyline with tangible signals to be controlled. Simple enough.
Let's start with management for example:
- Take management control system (executive): make the loop profit target, management, users

- Between product owner and developers

TODO:
CREATE A STORYLINE, first to express everything in words
FIND OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO CONTROL, SIGNAL VARIABLES. DUMMY 1-2 VALUE.
When we have POC, we can use this for example in estimating volume yearly sales.
We need to control all the variables for estimation.

Need paper for management control system, to see what tangibles we can control.
